Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 for a few reasons:
    1.) It is required for my major track (machine learning)
    2.) I want experience with popular data manipulation libraries like Pandas and SQL so I can create larger projects on my own time
    3.) I want to freshen up on my data analysis and processing skills. I've never taken a formal course in any type of data science.
